# NSE-Options-Open-Interest-Chart
To execute the program run this .py file by double clicking it.
Charts are made to auto update themselves after every minute.
There is some issue with the nse website so the program crashes some times as nse sends no data.
All you need to do is that relaunch the .py file again
